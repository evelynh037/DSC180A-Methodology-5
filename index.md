**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 
The most interesting topic covered in my domain is causal discovery, given complexity of the real world data, it is interesting to see how different algorithm unpack the complex causal relationship between variables across different domains(medical,economic,finance,social etc). It is also interesting to see how causal discovery is used with machine learnining, with reinforcement learning as an example to better design it's rewards for better model training and performance.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
We want to explore how Twitter sentiment might affect stock prices, specifically looking at whether tweets about a stock, reflecting people's buying or selling attitudes, can influence its price. Our goal is to use large language models (LLMs) combined with causal discovery methods to figure out if there’s a direct connection between sentiment and stock price changes, or if the sentiment is just correlated with price movements. This approach will help us understand if Twitter sentiment can be a useful predictor for forecasting stock prices.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
We may need to adjust the way we simulate the data to help the algorithm read our ground truth. For example, we can reduce the noise level introduced, adjust the equation to use for generating non-linear causal relationship to better model the normal distribution and other equations.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
We are interested in exploring more complex algorithm built based on the basic pc, fci, ges model as some of them are really slow to run. We want to see if the faster approach would largely reduced the runtime while maintaining performance. For project2, some technique we would be using would be based on our observation on algorithm we get experiment on in our project 1.
